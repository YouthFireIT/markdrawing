                            <h5>Q. How long does your artwork take to complete</h5>
                            <p>A. The Artwork itself takes approximately 10 to 12 days. Then if you choose to get it printed or on canvas, a further 3 to 5 business days to arrive. </p>

                            <h5>Q. Can you draw from separate pictures?</h5>
                            <p>A. Yes I can draw from separate pictures, in fact if you have two clear pictures it's even better for me as I can see the details in the face. </p>

                            <p>A. The more the merrier! There's no limit to the number of people in a single artwork. You can have it done with as much people as you want.</p>

                            <h5>Q. Do you do bigger sizes?</h5>
                            <p>A. No. But if you would like it bigger, then it is best to have it delivered through email and then you can print out or on a canvas any size you want. All drawings are done in high resolution, so you won't have any problems with the quality. </p>

                            <h5>Q. Can I pay cash when my drawing is delivered?</h5>
                            <p>A. At the moment we do not offer Cash payment upon delivery of your drawing but you can chose from any of our electronic payment options. Payment is required before we commence with the drawing. </p>

                            <h5>Q. How are these drawn?</h5>
                            <p>A. These are all hand drawn on paper and then scanned and printed either on photo grade paper or on canvas, to any size you want depending on your preference. The Digital styles of drawings that we offer are hand drawn on a tablet connected to a computer.</p>

                            <h5>Q. Can you edit the picture if I dont like it?</h5>
                            <p>A. As these take a long time to draw from scratch we do not edit the pictures as a rule. However if there is something majorly wrong with the picture of course it will be adjusted. However the final decision will come down to Charlie.</p>
